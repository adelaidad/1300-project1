<h2> <em>"I'm just bad at watching movies"</em></h2>
<p>I've said this statement more times than I can count. And it's not that the movies are bad, or that I don't like them. In fact, as a child, I watched Shrek about four times a week and I didn't have any trouble sitting through it. My favorite days as a child were when the substitute teacher rolled on the TV and played some movie that vaguely resembled our unit in class. So why is it that I have such a hard time watching movies? It isn't that I can't focus on a screen for 2 hours or that I find no pleasure in watching movies. In fact, I love going to the movie theater. And yet I was just not a movie person. It actually never bothered me much, I was perfectly content with watching Gilmore Girls in my spare time. It was only until my best friend, a movie lover, became a part of my life that I realized I am bad at watching movies. My friend's belief is that it's not that I'm bad at watching movies, I'm just watching the wrong ones. Big insult to my love for the Hannah Montana movies. As the pandemic arrived, and we spent more time indoors, I started to challenge myself to watch “important” movies. The ones that really matter according to movie experts. I started watching the movies that my friends believed would be the most influential in my path to understand more movies, doing so, I also started to recognize movies I had already watched and how important they are to my new found love of movies. As I check movies in my “to watch” list, I want to keep track of my opinions and reviews of the movies that I liked. Keep in mind that I am no expert in movies, and I only know Francis Coppola because I am a fan of Al Pacino. But maybe this guide for bad movie watchers may help.</p>

<h3>How the reviews work:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>IMDb:</strong>The IMDb rating looks at average rating for the movie, number of votes for the movie, and mean score across the whole report. IMDb ratings are calculated based on the cumulative votes of the site's users.</li>
    <li><strong>Rotten Tomatoes:</strong>The Rotten Tomato percentage corresponds to the percentage of reviews by critics on the website that are deemed as positive</li>
    <li><strong>My rating:</strong>Probably the least methodological. It represents how much I enjoyed the movie. 0 being I slept through it or was on my phone the whole time to 10 being that I can watch that movie on repeat until the end of my time.

<h3>Tips for good movie watching</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Watch them with someone who likes movies</dt>
        <dd>There is nothing more annoying than trying to watch a movie and hearing someone texting right next to you</dd>
    <dt>Have good snacks and food available</dt>
        <dd>Whether is popcorn or fruit having your favorite food will make you enjoy what youre doing much more. </dd>
    <dt>Be in an ambient setting</dt>
        <dd>I personally prefer a colder room, so I can get a blanket</dd>
    <dt>Learn how to be patient and sit still</dt>
        <dd>With TikTok and Instagram, our attention span has decreased significantly. Watching movies is a process of slower gratification. I think practicing being patient and enjoying the movies own pace is very beneficial in a high speed society </dd>

    <p class="leftmargin">Hi! Im Adelaida.
     Im a current engineering sophmore at Cornell University majoring in Information Science.

     I am 20 years old, love baking and watch a lot of media.

     My watching habits are sometimes a cause for concern but I get all my work done and I really do have fun while watching. I watch a lot of TV shows (and often rewatch my favorite ones like How to get away with Murder or Gilmore Girls)

     Over the past three years, a lot of my close friends have pointed out that for the amount of time I spend watching a screen, I dont seem to have watched what they considered the <em>important ones</em>. And now I challenge myself every month to watch atleast 2 new movies.

     A Bad Movie Watcher's Guide is my little blog to document my opinions on the movies that I have been watching. Its a casual blog that aims to create a space for bad movie watchers like me to become a little better at watching  movies.
