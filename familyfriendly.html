    <p class="nobackground">As I get older, I feel like family-friendly movies get a bad reputation. I understand that at times it might feel childish and a bit cringy (I definitely feel this when watching a movie and hearing a 17-year-old say “fudge” as a swear word), But there are some out there that are still so interesting and fun to watch. Take these recommendations, not as kids' movies, but as good movies your grandma can walk in on you watching, and there will be no awkwardness due to nudity.</p>

        <h3>Cool Runnings</h3>
        <h5>1993, Disney+</h5>
        <h5>IMDb Rating: 7/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 76% / My rating: 8.3/10 </h5>
        <p>This is a fun movie to watch. It's a feel-good perfection that will make you laugh. I'm actually a bit sad I first watched this as an adult because I would've loved it when I was little. The plot of the movie revolves around a few Jamaican sprinters who were disqualified from the Olympic Games, so they find a coach and start the first Jamaican Bobsled Team. The whole premise of the story is funny, to begin with because of the absurdity of the situation. The best part: it's partly true. A few years before the movie, there was in fact a Jamaica national bobsleigh team. This movie is just good laughs and silliness. It's a heartwarming underdog story but with a lot of laughter. This is a great movie to watch if you have younger siblings with you, but honestly even better if you just need to pick me up.</p>

         <h3>Porco Rosso</h3>
         <h5>1992, HBOmax</h5>
         <h5>IMDb rating: 7.7/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 95% /  My rating: 7.5/10</h5>
         <p>I am not the best at watching animated movies, and even fewer ones with subtitles. But this one is worth the watch. It's a Studio Ghibli movie, which is the film studio resposible for other big anime movies like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro. This movie is about a water pilot pig. Everyone else is mostly human in this film, except Porco Rosso. You actually never find out why he is a pig, but it is implied that some curse was brought upon him. It takes place in Italy, which is really fun for an anime setting. While I believe you can watch it dubbed into your language, I recommend watching it in Japanese. There is girl power, pirates, romance, and a lot of cuteness. You can't go wrong watching this.</p>

        <h3>Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers</h3>
        <h5>2022 Disney+</h5>
       <h5>IMDb rating: 7.6/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 80% / My rating: 9/10 </h5>
        <p>This movie is so good because of the nostalgia. If you grew up watching Disney Channel and Disney movies, you owe it to your inner child to watch it. The movie is about Chip and Dale and what happens after they become one hit wonder TV stars. The whole movie is actually about a criminal investigation, in which a bad guy (big spoiler) is taking TV cartoon stars and bootlegging them in fake Disney movies. It's just so anti-Disney because it parodies a lot of things. Additionally, it breaks the fourth wall various times and does it by poking fun at other famous Disney characters. Out of all the movies on this page, this one is definitely not one that would come close to winning an award. But it's kind of like those bad good movies. Personally, I think the nostalgia makes it worth it.
