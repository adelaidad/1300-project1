    <p class="nobackground">This is probably my favorite genre there is. Horror movies are not my thing, not because I am scared easily, I just don't mess with spirits. However, there is something about crime and mystery movies that draw me in. Whether it is not knowing how an inmate went to jail or wondering if they are going to get caught. They are always the movies I am most focused on.</p>

        <h3>Seven</h3>
         <h5>1995, Netflix</h5>
         <h5>IMDd rating: 8.6/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 82% / My rating: 8/10</h5>
        <p>First off, the casting is amazing. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow. This movie is about two detectives that are trying to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives. I always find that serial killer motives make for an interesting story, and the seven deadly sins is definitely a very specific motive for the killing. And just like it sounds, this is a dark movie to watch. But this movie is not all just trying to find the killer. He actually turns himself in halfway through the movie, making the movie focus on this messed-up character in depth. It's an interesting mystery movie because it's not just entertaining, it's kind of appalling. The length and the specifics of how the killings take place and the morality behind them are definitely an interesting dark elements of the movie. According to expectations, it's a pinnacle film of neo-noir, which just means dark, really. It's a really creepy movie, but one that I think is worth watching.

        <h3>Silence of the Lambs</h3>
        <h5>1991, Paramount</h5>
        <h5>IMDb rating: 8.6/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 95% /  My rating: 9.5/10</h5>
        <p>Let me just preface this by saying that there are more moths than lambs in this movie. This is the movie to watch if you want any thriller recommendations. It is technically a horror movie according to google, but I think it's more of a psychological thriller. The movie follows a young FBI trainee, Clarice Starling, who is asked to talk with Hannibal Lector, an extreme Cannibal guard in a high-security facility, in hopes that he will help the FBI find another serial killer. Hannibal the Cannibal is the definition of creepy. The way he talks, calm and slow but with a very twisted tone, is the best part of the movie. It can be a little graphic at times, after all, he is a cannibal, but it is definitely worth watching. It's interesting what these crime movies can do because you end up loving a character who is a really, terrible person. This movie is truly a classic, referenced in a lot of pop culture media, such as the Office.</p>

       <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
       <h5>1994, HBOmax</h5>
       <h5> IMDb rating: 9.3/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 91% / My rating: 9/10</h5>
        <p>I must say I did read the book before watching this movie and that always influences opinions. This movie will make every Rita Hayworth reference make sense. Again with Morgan Freeman, this movie is about Andy Dufresne, who is wrongly imprisoned in Shaw shank Penitentiary for killing his wife and her lover. Andy befriends Red (Freeman) who helps him settle and make the best out of prison, until well, he gets redemption. I don't want to ruin the movie, but this one is a good watch. It has the crime element, but it isn't mystery or horror. There is great acting, very inspiring monologues from Morgan Freeman, and a great classical prison movie.

        <h3>American Psycho</h3>
        <h5>2000, HBOmax</h5>
        <h5>IMDb rating: 7.6/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 69% / My rating: 8.5/10</h5>
        <p>The quirks in this movie are amazing. Patrick Bateman, the main character, has such a unique personality, that it's just enough to make the movie good. You know, those intrinsic thoughts that sometimes catch you off guard, this man acts on then. It takes place in New York City, where Bateman, an investment bank executive, hides his psychopathic ego from his co-workers. I have a good friend who made this whole argument about what Bateman represents in politics. I just think he is crazy, and it's entertaining. When watching this movie, I hope you enjoy the business card scene, I think it's so funny. A bit gruesome and has a lot of blood, but a twisted horror movie that doesn't need the darkness for it to be good.</p>
