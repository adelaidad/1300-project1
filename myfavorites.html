    <p class="nobackground">As the name spoils, these are my favorite movies. Most of them are widely known but not talked enough about. What I get from the list below is that my favorite movies seem to be some sort of technology/sci-fi/thought-provoking movie (which is a lot of props to give to Borat if I'm honest). They are mostly movies you watch and enjoy, but you keep thinking about them after they are finished. The ones you text your mom to watch. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.</p>

        <h3>her</h3>
        <h5>2013, Apple TV</h5>
        <h5> IMDb rating: 8/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 94% / My rating: 9.2/10</h5>
        <p>This movie is so good because it is what society will probaly get to in a very chilling way. The power of AI not only as means of mobilizing technology and labor, but also as a human computer interaction. Specially, substituting one of humanities need, companionship. One of the pinnacle dystopian cyberpunk movies out there and the most important that deals with AI and its unprecedented gain of conscious. Following the life of a lonely Theodore, he lives in a world so modern that Ai assistants are personal assistants smarter than we can imagine, when a new product rolls by that has the power to learn and adapt. Scarlet Johansson performance as the AI voice is so recognizable and very well casted. Paired with Joaquin Phoenix and Amy adams, its a stellar cast. The movie gets dark and explores the very future possibilities that may come with artificial companions.</p>

        <h3>The Truman Show</h3>
        <h5>1998, HBOmax</h5>
        <h5> IMDb rating: 8.2/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 95% / My rating: 9.7/10</h5>
        <p>A funny, tender, and thought-provoking film. I came across the Truman Show is one of those days when you just scroll through streaming platforms and can't find anything. My best friend had already watched it, but insisted we watch it anyway. This movie stars Jim Carrey, the actor who famously plays the Grinch and Ace Ventura. Truman lives in a perfect town, he has lived there all his life. It turns out, that it is all a stage. Americans have been watching his life unfold on TV for 20-something years. Everyone in the town is extras and actors, and yet Truman believes this is his life. It is such a unique plot and one that makes you question if you yourself are in a simulation as well. You definitely fall in love with Truman, partly for pity, but also because you hope he figures it out and can be set free. While the movie came out in 1998, I think it is really similar to our media-consuming society. We spend our days consuming the lives of bloggers and the Kardashians, following their moves and watching them grow old. A movie ahead of its time, truly.

        <h3>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</h3>
        <h5>2006, HBOmax</h5>
        <h5> IMDb rating: 7.3/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 90% / My rating: 9.3/10 </h5>
        <p>Borat is peak comedy to me. It is very offensive in the funniest way possible. Fair warning that this movie is not for everyone, there is some nudity and a lot of uncomfortable moments. The whole movie is just satire, and I don't think I've ever watched a movie like this. The movie is filmed as a documentary, and in many ways it is. It stars Sasha Baron Cohen, who plays Borat, a man from Kazakhstan who travels to the United States to learn about its culture. However, the only fictitious part of the movie is the character of Borat. Everything that Borat does, who he meets, and the conversations they have, are all real. The whole movie is practically improvisation. Part of the joke in this movie is that the people Borat encounters aren't in on the joke, so you have a very strange, vulgar, no-filter man talking to people who believe that's just who he is. Definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life.</p>
