    <p class="nobackground">Classic movies to me are movies that just need to be watched. They are complete cultural resets. That is not to say that the movies in the other categories aren't. Silence of the Lambs and Shawshank Redemption are both very highly rated among film reviews and often appear in “Movies to watch before you die” lists. The movies in this category may not be most people's favorite, or even have as high reviews as those in other categories. But I think they are movies that are widely known and most of them have huge fandoms behind them, in fact, I am definitely included in one of them. As someone who still has many movies to watch, these are some I think you must check off your list. </p>

       <h3>Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
       <h5>1980, Disney +</h5>
       <h5>IMDb rating: 8.7/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 94% / My rating: 8.5/10</h5>
       <p>The Empire strikes back is the prefect sequel to A New Hope and one of the best sequel movies, if not the best, in all of film. The story takes place a couple of months after the first in which we see the rebellion in hoth evading persecution by the empire. Vader is as menacing as ever and plays an important role in this movie. There is a love connection building between Han and Leia and Luke sets out to train with the force. Memorable characters are introduced in this movie such as the bounty hunt crew comprising of Boba Fett and Bosk as well as Lando Calrissian. The movie has it all, romance, action, suspense and incredible character development as well as an insane twist. Its a much needed improvement after A New Hope thanks to the hype and success of its predecessor.</p>

        <h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
        <h5>2004, HBOmax</h5>
        <h5>IMDb rating: 7.9/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 90% /  My rating: 9/10</h5>
        <p>I don't understand how there are people on this planet that haven't watched Harry Potter. This is definitely a biased review given that I've read the series 3 times and have multiple marathon watches yearly. While I acknowledge my bias, I still think it is absurd that people have never watched Harry Potter. I chose the Prisoner of Azkaban because it is one of the best, not only because the director is Mexican like me, but because out of all the movies (not including Half-Blood Prince) this one has a pretty dark vibe. I also think it's the most well-filmed movie in terms of actual technique. Obviously, you can't just watch the third one without watching the others, but it's definitely the one to be excited about. I think most people refrain from watching Harry Potter movies because most people know what the plot is, and it may seem a little childish. What I like about it is the fantasy. The world of Harry Potter is a magical space that really drags you in. Maybe it's the fan in me saying this, but I truly believe that it's a set of movies that can just make you escape. And yes, it is frustrating because Voldemort could've been dead by the first movie. But Harry Potter moves beyond the plot. As a matter of fact, my university's chime bell often plays the Harry Potter theme song, and I am convinced that for those 45 seconds, you romanticize the campus a little more, especially the gothic parts of Cornell that remind me of the castle. I understand if Harry Potter is not the movie for you, but for the sake of the culture and the possibility of going to Universal Studios and understanding the park, just watch it, please.</p>

        <h3>Mamma Mia</h3>
        <h5>2008, Amazon Prime</h5>
        <h5>IMDb rating: 6.5/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 55% / My rating: 8/10 </h5>
        <p>This is the perfect movie for the summer. Musical movies are not my favorite. In fact, I tried to watch James Corden and Jason Derulo in Cats once, and I absolutely hated it. But Mamma Mia is so significant. I watched Mamma Mia when I was much younger, and I've even gone to see it on Broadway. The movie takes place in Greece, where Sophie, the main protagonist, is getting married and invites 3 men that could be her father. The soundtrack is all ABBA, and it is a good time. Meryl Streep as the mom and Amanda Seyfried as Sophie. If you've ever been to a party and Dancing Queen comes on and people go wild, this movie is why. ABBA was obviously a very big group before this movie, but the Mamma Mia soundtrack is definitely one of the best musical movie soundtracks. I definitely wouldn't say this movie is the greatest, but it's the type of movie that you'll enjoy watching. The set design is gorgeous, and the story isn't bland and predictable. A great watch for a sleepover or fun night.</p>

        <h3>13 going on 30</h3>
        <h5>2004, HBOmax</h5>
        <h5>IMDb rating: 6.2/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 65% /  My rating: 7/10</h5>
        <p>This movie is just relatable and, adorable. 13 going on 30 represents what I believe romantic movies should be. I think that most modern romance movies, especially the Netflix ones, give no depth to the woman. Everything is about the relationship, and I simply don't think that's something that accurately represents being a woman. But 13 going on 30 is the complete opposite. Jenna Rink, played by Jennifer Gardner, is a thirteen-year-old who, while struggling to become popular and cool in middle school, wishes she could be thirty, flirty, and thriving. She wakes up the next morning, a successful 30 editors at the magazine of her dreams. But learning that becoming cool at 13 destroyed her relationship with her best friend, played by Mark Ruffalo. The romance is there, it's sweet, and it gives you butterflies, but you also see Jennifer Garner's character evolve with some depth. This movie is a great light romance movie and definitely one of the best ones of the early 2000s.  Important cultural implications of this movie are the famous Jenna Rink dress and the homage to Ariana Grande’s “Thank you next” music video.</p>

        <h3>Notting Hill</h3>
        <h5>1999 Peacock</h5>
        <h5>IMDb rating: 7.2/10 / Rotten Tomatoes: 84% / My rating: 8/10 </h5>
        <p>A truly witty and charmingly sophisticated romantic comedy. What makes Notting Hill one of the best romantic movies in my opinion is that the script is great. It's just a very well-written movie that isn't drowning in romantic clichés and stereotypes. It takes place in London, where a sad, mopey bookstore owner (Hugh Grant) receives a famous actress (Julia Roberts) as a customer in his store. You can imagine what happens next. Fame is not necessarily a trope that I particularly enjoy, but Julia Roberts as this famous actress is fun to watch. Her character is humble and charming and often seems like she got famous when she didn't want to. Hugh Grant is an amazing actor as well. It's a light romantic comedy where the characters really do have that chemistry.</p>
